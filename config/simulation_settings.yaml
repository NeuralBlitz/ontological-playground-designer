# ontological-playground-designer/config/simulation_settings.yaml

# --- Generic Simulation Parameters ---
# This section defines the default or configurable high-level parameters
# for any simulated world designed by the Ontological Playground Designer.
# These settings provide a flexible framework for the generated "world physics,"
# agent capacities, and environmental dynamics.
#
# The AI's `world_compiler.py` uses these as a base, then populates them with
# axiom-aligned specifics generated by the `rule_generator.py`.

simulation_defaults:
  # --- General Simulation Environment ---
  simulation_engine_version: "generic_agent_based_v1.0" # Target simulator interface
  initial_world_size:
    x_dim: 100
    y_dim: 100
    z_dim: 10 # For 3D simulations, 1 for 2D
  time_step_duration_ms: 100 # Milliseconds per simulation step
  max_simulation_steps: 50000 # Default total steps for a generated world's lifespan
  random_seed: null # Set to an integer for reproducible world generation, or null for dynamic

  # --- Environmental Parameters (Starting Conditions) ---
  initial_resource_distribution_model: "perlin_noise_scatter" # How resources are initially spread
  base_resource_regen_rate: 0.01 # Percentage of depleted resources that regrow per step
  environmental_diversity_index: 0.7 # Starting complexity/variety of environmental features
  natural_disaster_frequency: 0.0001 # Probability of a "natural disaster" event per step (e.g., resource depletion zone)
  environmental_axioms_active: True # Flag for the simulator to actively enforce axiom-aligned environment rules

  # --- Agent Parameters (Initial Population & Capabilities) ---
  initial_agent_count: 50
  agent_species_diversity: 5 # Number of distinct agent species/types
  base_agent_energy_consumption: 0.05 # Energy consumed per agent per step
  max_agent_lifespan_steps: 1000 # Default lifespan, can be overridden by generated rules
  initial_agent_cooperation_tendency: 0.5 # Starting bias for cooperation vs. competition (0.0 to 1.0)
  agent_learning_rate: 0.1 # How quickly agents adapt their behaviors
  agent_axioms_active: True # Flag for the simulator to actively enforce axiom-aligned agent rules

  # --- Social/Economic Parameters (If Applicable) ---
  has_social_structures: True
  has_economic_system: True
  initial_wealth_distribution_model: "uniform" # Uniform, normal, power_law
  trade_friction_coefficient: 0.05 # Cost associated with trading resources
  social_mobility_factor: 0.2 # How easily agents can change social standing/roles

  # --- Output & Logging Settings ---
  output_format: "JSON" # Output format for the generated world configuration
  simulation_log_level: "INFO" # Detail level for internal simulation logging
  enable_realtime_visualization: False # Whether the simulator should render visuals during runtime

# --- Custom World Templates (Placeholder for future expansion) ---
# For more specialized world types, specific templates could override these defaults.
# For example:
# custom_templates:
#   ecosystem_world:
#     initial_world_size: {x_dim: 200, y_dim: 200, z_dim: 1}
#     agent_species_diversity: 10
#     has_social_structures: False
#   economic_city_simulation:
#     initial_agent_count: 500
#     time_step_duration_ms: 50
#     initial_wealth_distribution_model: "normal"
