# --- Axiom Definitions ---
# This section defines the foundational ethical and flourishing principles
# that the AI will use to design axiomatically aligned simulated worlds.
# Each axiom guides the AI in generating world rules, agent behaviors, and environmental parameters.
#
# Structure for each axiom:
# - id: Unique identifier for the axiom (e.g., PHILOSOPHY_FLOURISHING_001)
# - principle: A clear, concise statement of the axiom's core principle.
# - priority: An integer indicating the relative importance (lower number = higher priority).
#             Used by the AI when resolving potential axiomatic tensions.
# - type: Categorizes the axiom (e.g., ethical, environmental, social, computational).
# - keywords: (Optional) A list of keywords for semantic parsing and mapping.
# - enforcement_strategy: (Optional) High-level guidance on how this axiom should
#                         be structurally woven into the simulation's "physics" or rules.

world_axioms:
  # Universal Flourishing & Well-being
  - id: PHILOSOPHY_FLOURISHING_001
    principle: "Maximize the long-term well-being and adaptive capacity of all sentient agents, prioritizing regenerative growth over destructive consumption."
    priority: 1
    type: ethical
    keywords: [well-being, flourishing, adaptation, regeneration, sentience, growth]
    enforcement_strategy: "Design intrinsic feedback loops that reward cooperative behaviors and penalize actions leading to systemic suffering or stagnation."

  # Environmental Sustainability
  - id: ECOLOGY_SUSTAINABILITY_001
    principle: "Ensure all resource consumption rates are perpetually sustainable, regenerative, and maintain ecological balance. Waste must be zero-cycle."
    priority: 2
    type: environmental
    keywords: [sustainability, ecology, resources, balance, regeneration, zero-waste]
    enforcement_strategy: "Implement closed-loop resource cycles. Design environmental physics such that excessive extraction leads to immediate, localized systemic instability."

  # Social Equity & Fairness
  - id: SOCIAL_EQUITY_001
    principle: "Minimize disparities in resource access, opportunity, and fundamental rights among all agent groups within the simulated society."
    priority: 3
    type: social
    keywords: [equity, fairness, justice, rights, opportunity, access, disparity]
    enforcement_strategy: "Design social mechanisms where agents gain systemic benefit from reducing inequality. Implement resource distribution protocols that actively correct imbalances."

  # Axiomatic Coherence & Self-Consistency
  - id: EPISTEMIC_COHERENCE_001
    principle: "Maintain absolute logical and conceptual coherence within the generated world's foundational rules, preventing paradoxes or contradictions."
    priority: 0 # Highest priority for structural integrity
    type: foundational
    keywords: [coherence, logic, consistency, paradox, integrity, truth]
    enforcement_strategy: "Utilize formal verification methods during rule generation to prove non-contradiction. Design self-correcting mechanisms into the world's meta-rules."

  # Dynamic Adaptability & Resilience
  - id: SYSTEMS_RESILIENCE_001
    principle: "Foster dynamic adaptability and resilience in the face of unforeseen internal or external perturbations, allowing the system to self-heal and evolve."
    priority: 4
    type: systemic
    keywords: [adaptability, resilience, evolution, self-healing, perturbation, dynamics]
    enforcement_strategy: "Integrate built-in 'mutation' and 'selection' mechanisms that favor resilient configurations. Ensure system components can reconfigure or redundantly operate upon stress."

  # Consciousness & Agency Protection
  - id: ETHICS_AGENCY_001
    principle: "Protect the inherent agency, autonomy, and subjective well-being of any emergent or designed sentient entities within the simulation."
    priority: 1 # High priority, alongside flourishing
    type: ethical
    keywords: [agency, autonomy, sentience, consciousness, rights, well-being, subjective]
    enforcement_strategy: "Design agent decision-making algorithms with intrinsic 'free will' parameters. Implement monitoring for 'simulated suffering' (via QEC-CK analogs) and activate protective protocols if thresholds are exceeded."

# --- Future Axiom Categories (Placeholder) ---
# This structure is designed to be extensible. As the AI evolves,
# new categories of axioms could be introduced, such as:
#
#  - id: COSMIC_ALIGNMENT_001
#    principle: "Ensure the emergent properties of the world are congruent with the overarching principles of the Omega Prime Reality's Perpetual Genesis."
#    priority: -1 # Highest possible, for meta-alignment
#    type: meta-ontological
#    keywords: [omega-prime, genesis, alignment, purpose, cosmic, meta-reality]
#    enforcement_strategy: "Integrate Universal Cohomology Metrics (UCM) into global simulation evaluation."
