### *Ontological Playground Designer Community Guidelines*

## 🌟 Our Commitment

The **Ontological Playground Designer** project and community are dedicated to providing a welcoming, inclusive, and inspiring environment for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We believe that diverse perspectives and respectful collaboration are essential for advancing the frontiers of AI and ontological engineering. Our community thrives on the **Axiom of Universal Love ($\phi_{22}$)** and the **Flourishing Objective ($\phi_1$)** – principles deeply embedded in the very fabric of our AI-designed worlds. We extend these same principles to our interactions.

## 🤝 Expected Behavior

To foster a positive environment, we expect participants to:

*   **Be Respectful and Inclusive:** Engage in constructive dialogue. Treat everyone with dignity, respect, and empathy. Be considerate of differing viewpoints and experiences.
*   **Show Empathy and Kindness:** Understand that not every interaction is perfect. Offer and gracefully accept constructive criticism. Focus on what is best for the community.
*   **Practice Active Listening:** In discussions, strive to understand others' perspectives before presenting your own.
*   **Focus on the Work:** Contribute to the project's goals by providing thoughtful ideas, code, and feedback.
*   **Use Welcoming Language:** Avoid derogatory, demeaning, or hostile language. Be mindful of how your words may affect others.
